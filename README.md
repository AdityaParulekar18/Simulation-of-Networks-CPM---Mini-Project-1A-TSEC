# Simulation-of-Networks-CPM---Mini-Project-1A-TSEC
The project aims to provide a comprehensive simulation of network planning and project management techniques using Critical Path Method (CPM) .

Critical Path Method (CPM) is a project management technique, where planning, scheduling and controlling of well-defined tasks takes place. CPM breaks down a project into a sequence of activities. Each activity has a defined duration and is dependent on the completion of preceding activities. The critical path in a CPM network is the longest path in terms of the total duration of the project. Any delay in activities on the critical path will directly impact the project's overall duration.
